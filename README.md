# Facade

The code demonstrates the implementation of the Facade design pattern in C#. 

The Facade class provides a simple interface to a complex system of classes, which in this case are the SubSystemA, SubSystemB, and SubSystemC classes. 

The Client code interacts with the Facade class to execute complex operations without having to directly interact with the underlying subsystems. 

In this example, the Facade class provides two operations, Operation1 and Operation2, that are composed of calls to methods of the subsystem classes.
